Education aims at learning a skill to lead life and forming one’s personality rather than transferring information and acquiring knowledge. It’s an ennobling process of growth.
Kendriya Vidyalya Bolarum always stands ahead in its pedagogical approach and innovative methodologies. We have unique and creative ways of teaching and learning. At the same time, we always try to look into our deficiencies and transform them into opportunities.We are bound to prepare our students mentally and physically to face the new global challenges and opportunities. Also we kindle in the young minds the courage to be good human beings and inculcate values; and the fascination to tune their senses to explore the nature and their surroundings.Our Vidyalaya is going through a period of tre-mendous changes both spatially and mentally. We still have many plans and dreams for the years to come.
